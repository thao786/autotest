[open intro page]
welcome to UI Check. This guide will show you how to create tests and run it on our platform.

[once in /suites. create a suite]
first u need to create a suite. a test belongs to a suite. lets create one called 'testing'

[create a test]
now we can create tests. lets make one called 'browsing'. our test is now created.

[point to the Extension red symbol on address bar]
lets try recording some steps with Google Extension. Before that make sure it is installed and activated.

[click Record Steps. Open reddit.com and browse around]
now we are ready to record steps. Lets open reddit.com and see if UI Check can recognize the actions. When running test, browsers opened by Selenium does not have plugins or logged in state like your personal computer, so please keep that in mind.

[click Stop Recording Steps]
think I've read enough on reddit. lets look at the recorded actions. Here they are. We might want to edit those steps. Like this pageload, dont think I intentionally open the url. It was the result of my clicking on a link. so lets remove it.

edit click

create new step at last

[define some assertion]
you can choose from a list of assertions here. lets try HTMl Contained in Page.

[click Run Test]
now we are ready to run the test. its going to take a few minutes for the test to run. ...

[click play Video]
now its done. so our assertion did not pass. the final page does not seem to contain the keyword. lets confirm in the result video.

[]
this concludes our test. thanks for watching.
