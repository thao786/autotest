Thuy:
- highlight pageload: is this the result of a click or Js? if yes, user needs to remove the step
- assertions: make it clear that it's JS
- make click dropdownlist copyable



REDESIGN
- redesign login screens
- redesign modal errors
- make inactive steps more obvious
- mark all Interpolatable fields obvious



Thao:
- better click editing
- paginations
- run test with FireFox too
- detect browser to show Warning

- better user exprience when running test: show all warnings. Ex: we use window name to determine tabs. messing with it while using multiple tabs results in disasters

    The testing environment doesnt have google plugins so make sure its the same

- when 500 happens, email Thao
- make video private. only show temporary url
- make local do HTTPS
- only accepts numbers for eq


WRITE usage tutorials:
- create video to demonstrate concepts (get someone's perfect english)
- warn users about pageload step: they might need to delete this

- create test BEFORE VS AFTER the feature is built: Test driver development
