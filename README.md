Thuy:
- highlight pageload: is this the result of a click or Js? if yes, user needs to remove the step
- delete step -> delete this comment? pop up box
- step show: perform action, and THEN wait
- display video instead of screenshots
- assertions: make it clear that it's JS
- failed assertions: none if there's 0




REDESIGN
- redesign login screens
- redesign modal errors
- make inactive steps more obvious
- mark all Interpolatable fields obvious




Thao:
- sign in failure should output error
- if click fails, click with JS




WRITE usage tutorials:
- link to usage page from all keywords
- create video to demonstrate concepts (get someone's perfect english)
- warn users about pageload step: they might need to delete this
- the assertion should output TRUE
- emphasize Autotest can handle multiple tabs
- make it clear that Autotest use OCR to see visible text
