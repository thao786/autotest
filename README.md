Thuy:
- dont show Edit Step for new typed steps

- test recording is valid until HOURS ONLY
- add back SUITE EDIT

- top banner resize when screen resize
- split editing click into 2 side by side forms
    
- highlight pageload: is this the result of a click or JS? if yes, user needs to remove the step
- make click dropdownlist copyable



REDESIGN
- redesign modal errors



Thao:
- create template for each code
- translate code to understand HIT ENTER
- detect ACCEPT ALERT BOX


- when 500 happens, email Thao
- make local do HTTPS




Brandon's ideas
- use cases
- prefers onsite forms
- help users set up whole project: download eclipse projects
maybe turn whole suite into 1 project
- developers want to translate code into steps
admins n managers, business analyst want to understand selenium code => translate code into steps
