Thuy:
- highlight pageload: is this the result of a click or Js? if yes, user needs to remove the step
- delete step -> delete this comment? pop up box
- step show: perform action, and THEN wait
- assertions: make it clear that it's JS
- make click dropdownlist copyable




REDESIGN
- redesign login screens
- redesign modal errors
- make inactive steps more obvious
