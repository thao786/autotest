Thuy:
- dont show Edit Step for new typed steps
- test recording is valid until HOURS ONLY
- add back SUITE EDIT
- top banner resize when screen resize
- split editing click into 2 side by side forms
    
- highlight pageload: is this the result of a click or JS? if yes, user needs to remove the step
- make click dropdownlist copyable



REDESIGN
- redesign modal errors



Thao:
- for HIT ENTER, ALERT,  dont read by chunks. 1 draft translates to 1 step 
- translate code to understand HIT ENTER
- when 500 happens, email Thao
- make local do HTTPS



LACKING ACTIVITIES:
- alert box
- drag and drop
- maximize windows
- double click
- upload a file
- listen to iframe's activities



Brandon's ideas
- use cases
- prefers onsite forms
- help users set up whole project: download eclipse projects
maybe turn whole suite into 1 project
- developers want to translate code into steps
admins n managers, business analyst want to understand selenium code => translate code into steps
