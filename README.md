Thuy:
- redesign
- mark all click field as required
- make incomplete New Step as inactive (active = false)
- remove editable fields like wait on step/show.html.erb and add them to forms
- create edit screen for scroll action
- improve error message



Thao:
- make test params/extracts work: use ruby's interpolation style
- make body_text6 undeletable
- install SSL
- make project live
- find button text with XPaths
- find an ORM for java to match Result to DB



only use Interpolation in assertion and other fields like pageload, typing
no Interpolation in: extracts, test params



WRITE usage tutorials: 
- link to usage page from all keywords
- create video to demonstrate concepts (get a guy's perfect english)
- warn users about pageload step: they might need to delete this
