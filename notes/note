is it just easier to record coordination in web page just like mobile?
probably should have both

actions on PHONE that needs to be tracked:
- swipe left/right/up/down: use onmousemoveto detect these
- hold down a button for how long




tap on screen: 
Appium::TouchAction.new.tap(x: 300, y: 600 fingers:1).release.perform


HOW TO CAPTURE UI-AUTOMATOR ALL Device Screenshot?




USEFUL COMMANDS:
Rails.application.config.assets.paths


monkeyrunner commands that might be useful:
findViewWithText
device.touch(By.id('view_id'), MonkeyDevice.DOWN_AND_UP)

view = vc.findViewWithText('Dsiplay')
view.touch()

check the order of LinearLayout that user clicked on

you can use uiautomator to channel the ui to user's view somehow.
